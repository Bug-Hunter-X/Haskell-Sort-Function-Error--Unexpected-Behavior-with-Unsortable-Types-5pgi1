```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```

This code has a subtle bug related to the use of `sort` from `Data.List`. While it works correctly for lists of numbers, it can behave unexpectedly if the list contains elements that cannot be directly compared using the default `Ord` instance. For instance, if you were to replace the `xs` with a list of strings:

```haskell
let xs = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

The `sort` function would work correctly here.  However, if you had a list of functions:
```haskell
let xs = [(+1), (*2)]
```
You'll encounter a compile-time error because functions don't have a default `Ord` instance, preventing them from being sorted.
